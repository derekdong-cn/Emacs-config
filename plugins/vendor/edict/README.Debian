This package provides access to Edict from within Emacs.
Two main commands are provided:

* `edict-search-english': Search the Edict dictionary for an English
  word.  Default word is the word at point, if any.

* `edict-search-kanji': Search the dictionary for the Japanese phrase
  in the current region.

  You might want to add keybindings for these functions.  Cut and
paste the contents of /usr/share/doc/edict-el/dot-emacs into your
.emacs startup file.  That should bind `edict-search-english' to `M-*'
and `edict-search-kanji' to `M-_'.
